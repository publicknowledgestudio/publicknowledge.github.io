Hi, I’m Devina — a designer who loves creating designs that not only look good but also make sense, feel good to use, and bring a little joy along the way.

I’ve worked across visual design, UX research, and interface design, and I’m always excited to try new tools, explore fresh ideas, and build interactive experiences that spark curiosity — for both the user and me.

When I’m not designing, you’ll probably find me obsessively collecting movies I’ll probably never watch, and discovering new food spots all around the city
