Anandu is a designer and visual thinker who moves fluidly across disciplines in product design, 3D, typography, and motion, bringing a multidisciplinary perspective to every project. With a background in architecture and experience leading design at early-stage startups, he has developed a practice that blends craft, experimentation, and systems thinking.

He is drawn to projects where technology and design meet to shape human experience, whether building digital products, creating brand identities, or crafting visuals for music and culture. At the core of his work is a curiosity for how ideas can be transformed into clear, memorable experiences.
