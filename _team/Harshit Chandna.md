I’m Harshit, currently interning as a UX designer and spending most of my time figuring out how to make things feel smoother, smarter, and just…better. I love solving real problems through design, and I’m always down to learn something new along the way. Outside of work, you’ll probably find me lost in a playlist or sketching out random ideas that may or may not make sense.

Living by the GOAT's quote :

*"Always grateful for what I have, aiming for what I don’t."*
