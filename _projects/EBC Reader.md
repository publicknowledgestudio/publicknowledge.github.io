# Brief

Founded in 1942, the EBC Group is a giant in the legal publishing space in India. We helped them reimagine the brand and experiences for their e-Library offering, EBC Reader, for an AI-first era. We delivered a visual and strategic overhaul of EBC Reader, introducing LLM capabilities and enhancing content discovery for legal professionals.
